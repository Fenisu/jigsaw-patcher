How to run the source code under Linux and Windows. I don't own a Mac so I don't know what do you have to do. 

== Linux ==

The programs and dependencies are *python 2.6*, *gtk2*, *pygtk*, *pygobject* and *pycairo*

Any modern distro would bring it by default, otherwise just google for a howto pygtk in 0, seconds for your distro. You will probably need root access.

== Windows ==

You need some dependencies to be able to run the application. For a detailed explanation follow this [http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html link].

The programs and dependencies are *python 2.6*, *gtk2*, *pygtk*, *pygobject* and *pycairo*. Some useful links:
